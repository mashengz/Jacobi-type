# Jacobi-G algorithm for unitary group  

This repository reproduces the numerical experiments from the preprint:
```
@misc{arxiv:1905.12295,
    title={Approximate matrix and tensor diagonalization by unitary transformations: convergence of Jacobi-type algorithms},
    author={Konstantin Usevich and Jianze Li and Pierre Comon},
    year={2019},
    eprint={1905.12295},
    archivePrefix={arXiv},
    primaryClass={math.OC}
}
```
The figures can be reproduced by running `main_test.m`.

## Prerequisites 
 * The code was tested on MATLAB R2019b, but should run on previous versions.
 * [Manopt](https://www.manopt.org/) should be installed and should be on the MATLAB path.
