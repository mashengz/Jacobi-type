Uses guide for JacobiG.

The codes are used to tensor diagonalization for symmetric (real or complex) tensors,
and are downloaded from https://github.com/kdu/jacobi-G-unitary-matlab.

The main contributors to this code are Usevich, Li and Comon.

Please refer to their paper as follows:

@article{Usevich2020,
   title={Approximate matrix and tensor diagonalization by unitary transformations: convergence of {J}acobi-type algorithms},
   author={Usevich, K. and Li, J. and Comon, P.},
   journal={SIAM Journal on Optimization},
   volume={30},
   number={4},
   pages={2998--3028},
   year={2020},
}

In fact, some codes are modified based on jacobi-G-unitary-matlab.

The main functions are JacobiG_2.m and JacobiG_2P.m. 

Please see the examplary files main_test.m for how to use it.
